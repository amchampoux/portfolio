          <h1>Hi, I am Anne-Marie.</h1>
          <p>I am a Product Designer and Front-end Developer with a passion for creating user-centric products. I am committed to deliver engaging and meaningful user experiences.</p>
          <p>Every time someone enjoys an application I worked on, it reminds my motivations: Helping people in their daily life, improving productivity at work, easing access to information, or entertaining.</p>
          <p>As far as I remember, I have always had an attraction and talent for the arts. It took time before I find my way into digital design. With the rise of social media, I realize that I wanted to have an impact on people through the technology that was taking more and more place in our lives.</p>
          <p>I completed a Master's degree in Interaction design at Laval University where I learned about interface design, information architecture, and design fundamentals.</p>
          <p>From there, my career as a UX designer started. I had the chance to work in various fields:</p>
          <ul className={styles.fields}>
            <li>üí∞ Banking</li>
            <li>üì∫ Entertainment</li>
            <li>üç∑ E-Commerce</li>
            <li>‚úàÔ∏è Traveling</li>
            <li> And more!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It is fulfilling to immerse yourself in a new environment and to create a product that matters.</p>
          <p>Working in interactive agencies for more than 12 years now, I had the chance to were multiple hats, including the one of Product Owner. As well, during the last few years, I decided to leap into development. </p>
          <p>Hard work pays off, and today, I am happy to be working on what I love ‚ù§Ô∏è </p>
