            <p>In collaboration with the Videotron team, the first step was to understand the new mobile roaming pass technical requirements. The engineering team led a couple of working sessions to share their knowledge with the product and design team.</p>
            <p>Then, it was important to understand how travelers interact with their mobile service when outside of their service coverage zone. Time was running, but we did a few interviews with frequent and occasional travelers. Here are some of the key findings:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Occasional travelers are stressed about getting charged for data usage.</li>
              <li>During a trip, people are often in a hurry and donâ€™t have time to read.</li>
              <li>Most people don't know exactly where to find information about roaming and tend to call the customer center before their travel.</li>
